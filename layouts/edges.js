/**
 * This is a hot loadable layout for nwm. See module.exports 
 * at end of the file for details.
 *
 * Edges:
 *
 * This is not a dynamic layout, but rather a static one.
 * Basically, it allows you to move windows with your numpad to fixed locations
 * on this layout.
 *
 * You can explicitly move windows to different corners:
 * - Using numpad keys 
 * - Using:
 *  qwe
 *  asd
 *  zxc
 * (as my laptop doesn't have a numpad)
 *
 * My main purpose here is to make sure that nwm can support all kinds of layouts
 * - and more importantly, to build and test support remapping global keyboard
 * shortcuts on the go.
